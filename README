gunicorn-init
=============

This project provides an init script for the [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org)
project.

You can run multiple python web application by setting multiple configuration
files.



Basic Usage
-----------

You will find in the tree directory an example of how to use this script.

For instance, each file in the `CONF_DIR` directory (`/etc/gunicorn` by default)
represents a web application. For each configuration file, the PID of the master
Gunicorn process is stored in `/var/run/gunicorn/<conf>.pid`, and logs are
printed to `/var/log/gunicorn/<conf>.log`.


### Script configuration

The script configuration file is `/etc/default/gunicorn`. You have three
variables to set:

 * `RUN <yes|no>`, should the script run on system boot ?
 * `CONF_DIR`, where are the web application configuration files ?
 * `CONFIGS`, which configuration file(s) to load ?

### Web application configuration

For the web application configuration file, you have four possible variables:

 * `WORKING_DIR`, the script will change to this directory before launching
Gunicorn.
 * `APP_MODULE`, Python module and callable to run.
 * `CONFIG_FILE`, Python Gunicorn configuration file path.
 * `LOG_LEVEL`, logging level.

### Init script

These are the different actions allowed by the init script:

 * `start`, starts all defined configuration files. The `RUN` variable must be
set to `yes`.
 * `stop`, stops all defined configuration files.
 * `restart`, restarts all defined configuration files.
 * `reload`, reloads (`kill -HUP`) all defined configuration files.

 * `start_one <conf>`, starts the given configuration file.
 * `stop_one <conf>`, stops the given configuration file.
 * `reload_one <conf>`, reloads the given configuration file.

 * `inc <conf>`, increase workers for the given configuration file.
 * `dec <conf>`, decrease workers for the given configuration file.
